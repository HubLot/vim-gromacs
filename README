Vim Files to enable syntax hightlighting for Gromacs files.

Works with only mdp file for the moment

Installation:

Go to your ~/.vim directory

If "syntax" and ftdetect directories don't exist, copy them from github.
If they are, copy only files inside. Otherwise, existing files will be replaced.
