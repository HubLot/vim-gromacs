Vim-Gromacs
===========

Vim-Gromacs is a plugin to easy manipulate Gromacs files in Vi/Vim.

It contains a set of files to enable syntax highlighting for Gromacs files.
For the moment, it works with mdp, gro, top/itp, xvg and ndx files.

It contains also macros to comment/uncomment easily selections of a file and to
jump to different sections (*[...]*) of a file.

The plugin also provides contextual autocompletion in mdp files.


Installation
------------

+ **Manual Way**

Go to your ~/.vim directory.

If *syntax*, *ftdetect* and *ftplugin* directories don't exist, copy them from
github.  If they are, copy only files inside. Otherwise, existing files will be
replaced.

+ **Pathogen Way**

Pathogen is a vim module which allows to load modules from there own directory.

Install pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and then clone this
repository in ~/.vim/bundle. It works.

+ **VimBall Way (Vim >= 7.0)**

Get the vimball *gromacs.vba*.
Open it with vi and type:

::

  :so %
  :q!



+ **OS Supported**

Vim-Gromacs has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 10.04 and 11.04, Debian Squeeze,
Fedora 16 and 17 and Mac OS X.

Please let us know if it's working on other distros.

Get Started
-----------

Syntax highlighting should be automatic.

To use macros, you need to allow filetype plugins : "filetype plugin on" in
your *.vimrc*.

(If you want to have gromacs macros always allowed, move gromacs.vim from
*~/.vim/ftplugin* to *~/.vim/plugin*)

To activate contextual completion in mdp files, add the following line in your
*.vimrc*:

    autocmd FileType mdp.gromacs set omnifunc=mdpcomplete#Complete

Then completion is triggered in insert mode by <C-x><C-o>.

Tricks
-------

Change the shortcut for completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shortcut that trigger the contextual completion in MDP files is long to
type. It can be changed however. With the following instruction in your
*.vimrc*, <C-n> will trigger the completion. The change will be active only for
MDP files.

    autocmd FileType mdp.gromacs imap <C-n> <C-x><C-o>

Suggest values when you type =
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have the possible values suggested when you write the = in a MDP file, just
add the following line in your *vimrc*:

    autocmd FileType mdp.gromacs imap <silent> <buffer> = = <C-X><C-O>

Complete as you type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the previous trick you might want the completion pop-up to
appears as you type. To get this you will need the `AutoComplPop
<http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1879>`_ plugin which depends
to the `L9 <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3252>`_ one. Once
you have this plugin installed, add the following instructions to your
*.vimrc*:

::

    function! Meet(text)
        return len(a:text)
    endfunction

    function! DoNothing()
        return 1
    endfunction

    let g:acp_behavior = {'mdp.gromacs': [{'command' : "\<C-x>\<C-o>",
        \ 'commandfunc': 'mdpcomplete#Complete',
        \ 'meets': 'Meet', 'onPopupClose': 'DoNothing', 'repeat': 1}]}

Usage
-----

Shortcuts for the macros:

* ]; -- Comment the selection
* ]: -- Uncomment the selection
* ]j -- Jump to the next section
* ]k -- Jump to the previous section

A section is defined by '[....]'
